  @moduledoc """
  Assertion macros for an eventually consistent world
  Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we want to assert that some condition holds, but it doesn't
  hold just _yet_. Enter `eventual_assertions`. This module will repeatedly try your assertions
  and stop when they're true (or false). It does all of this without using `Elixir.Process.sleep/1`.
  Use just like you would `assert` or `refute`
