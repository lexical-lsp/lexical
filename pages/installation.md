# Installation

The following instructions document how to install Lexical after
building from source. Some editors, like Visual Studio Code, have the
ability to automatically install the latest version of Lexical for
you.

## Caveats

Lexical supports the following versions of Elixir and Erlang:

| Erlang      | Version range    | Notes  |
| ----------- |----------------- | ------ |
|  24         | `>= 24.3.4.12`   | Might run on older versions; this was the lowest that would compile on arm |
|  25         | `>= 25.0`        |        |
|  26         | `>= 26.0.2`      |        |

| Elixir   | Version Range  | Notes    |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1.13     |    `>= 1.13.4` |          |
| 1.14     |    `all`       |          |
| 1.15     | `>= 1.15.3`    | `1.15.0` - `1.15.2` had compiler bugs that prevented lexical from working |

Lexical can run projects in any version of Elixir and Erlang that it
supports, but it's important to understand that Lexical needs to be
compiled under the lowest version of elixir and erlang that you intend
to use it with. That means if you have the following projects:

   * `first`: elixir `1.14.4` erlang `24.3.2`
   * `second`: elixir `1.14.3` erlang `25.0`
   * `third`: elixir: `1.13.3` erlang `25.2.3`

Lexical would need to be compiled with Erlang `24.3.2` and Elixir `1.13.3`.
Lexical's prepackaged builds use Erlang `24.3.4.12` and Elixir `1.13.4`

## Prerequisites
First, Install git LFS by [following these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

Then, clone the git repository. Do this with

```elixir
git clone git@github.com:lexical-lsp/lexical.git
```

Then change to the lexical directory

```shell
cd lexical
```

Then fetch lexical's dependencies

```shell
mix deps.get
```

...and build the project

```shell
mix package
```

If things complete successfully, you will then have a release in your
`_build/dev/package/lexical` directory. If you see errors, please file a
bug.

For the following examples, assume the absolute path to your Lexical
source code is `/my/home/projects/lexical`.

### Enabling indexing

We've recently added indexing support to lexical. This powers features like `find references` and will go on to power a host of other features. While we're continuting to 
develop indexing, we've disabled it by default. If you want to enable indexing (and find references), build lexical like this:

```shell
INDEXING_ENABLED=true mix package
```

## Editor-specific setup
1. [Vanilla Emacs with lsp-mode](#vanilla-emacs-with-lsp-mode)
2. [Vanilla Emacs with eglot](#vanilla-emacs-with-eglot)
3. [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code)
4. [neovim](#neovim)
5. [Vim + ALE](#vim--ale)
6. [Vim + Vim-LSP](#vim--vim-lsp)
7. [Helix](#helix)

### Vanilla Emacs with lsp-mode
The emacs instructions assume you're using `use-package`, which you
really should be. In your `.emacs.d/init.el` (or wherever you put your
emacs configuration), insert the following code:

```lisp
(use-package lsp-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq lsp-modeline-code-actions-segments '(count icon name))

  :init
  '(lsp-mode))


(use-package elixir-mode
  :ensure t
  :custom
  (lsp-elixir-server-command '("/my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh")))

```

Restart emacs, and Lexical should start when you open a file with a
`.ex` extension.


### Vanilla Emacs with eglot

Eglot in Emacs 30 already has built-in support for Lexical after
commit 9e0524a8820fbb8fdb155b1ca58919dcfcaffd63.

If you're using Emacs 30 and before that commit, it's recommended to
update Emacs, but you can add lexical support in the following way:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (setf (alist-get '(elixir-mode elixir-ts-mode heex-ts-mode)
                   eglot-server-programs
                   nil nil #'equal)
        (if (and (fboundp 'w32-shell-dos-semantics)
                 (w32-shell-dos-semantics))
            '("language_server.bat")
          (eglot-alternatives
           '("language_server.sh" "start_lexical.sh")))))
```

For versions before 30, you can add Eglot support for Lexical in the
following way:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (setf (alist-get 'elixir-mode eglot-server-programs)
        (if (and (fboundp 'w32-shell-dos-semantics)
                 (w32-shell-dos-semantics))
            '("language_server.bat")
          (eglot-alternatives
           '("language_server.sh" "start_lexical.sh")))))
```

If you're using `elixir-ts-mode` on Emacs 29, you can add a new entry
for Eglot:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               `((elixir-ts-mode heex-ts-mode) .
                 ,(if (and (fboundp 'w32-shell-dos-semantics)
                           (w32-shell-dos-semantics))
                      '("language_server.bat")
                    (eglot-alternatives
                     '("language_server.sh" "start_lexical.sh"))))))
```


### Visual Studio Code

Click on the extensions button on the sidebar, then search for
`lexical`, then click `install`.  By default, the extension will automatically
download the latest version of Lexical.

To change to a local executable, go to `Settings -> Extensions -> Lexical` and
type `/my/home/projects/lexical/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin` into the text box in
the `Server: Release path override` section.

### neovim

Lexical requires neovim `>= 0.9.0`.

In version `>= 0.9.0`, the key is to append the custom LS
configuration to
[lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig), so regardless
of whether you are using mason or others, you can use this
configuration below as a reference:

```lua
    local lspconfig = require("lspconfig")
    local configs = require("lspconfig.configs")

    local lexical_config = {
      filetypes = { "elixir", "eelixir", },
      cmd = { "/my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh" },
      settings = {},
    }

    if not configs.lexical then
      configs.lexical = {
        default_config = {
          filetypes = lexical_config.filetypes,
          cmd = lexical_config.cmd,
          root_dir = function(fname)
            return lspconfig.util.root_pattern("mix.exs", ".git")(fname) or vim.loop.os_homedir()
          end,
          -- optional settings
          settings = lexical_config.settings,
        },
      }
    end

    lspconfig.lexical.setup({})
```

If the configuration above doesn't work for you, please try this minimal [neovim configuration](https://github.com/scottming/nvim-mini-for-lexical), It can eliminate other plugin factors.

### Vim + ALE

[ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) includes built-in LSP support for Lexical.
To enable it, you'll need to tell ALE where your Lexical release is located (including
the `bin` directory) and add `lexical` to the list of enabled Elixir linters.

A good way to do this is to add the following to a `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/elixir.vim`
file:

```viml
let b:ale_linters = ['lexical', 'mix']
let b:ale_elixir_lexical_release = '/my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin'
```

That will automatically enable the `lexical` and `mix` linters for all buffers with
the `elixir` file type.

### Vim + Vim-LSP

An example of configuring Lexical as the Elixir language server for
[Vim-LSP](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp). Uses the newer vim9script syntax but
can be converted to Vim 8 etc (`:h vim9script`).

```vim9script

# Loading vim-lsp with minpac:
call minpac#add("prabirshrestha/vim-lsp")
# ...or use your package manager of choice/Vim native packages

# Useful for debugging vim-lsp:
# g:lsp_log_verbose = 1
# g:lsp_log_file = expand('~/vim-lsp.log')

# Configure as the elixir language server
if executable("elixir")
    augroup lsp_lexical
    autocmd!
    autocmd User lsp_setup call lsp#register_server({ name: "lexical", cmd: (server_info) => "{{path_to_lexical}}/lexical-lsp/lexical/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh", allowlist: ["elixir", "eelixir"] })
    autocmd FileType elixir setlocal omnifunc=lsp#complete
    autocmd FileType eelixir setlocal omnifunc=lsp#complete
    augroup end
endif

```

If you use [Vim-LSP-Settings](mattn/vim-lsp-settings) for installing and configuring language servers,
you can use the following flag to disable prompts to install elixir-ls:

```viml
g:lsp_settings_filetype_elixir = ["lexical"]

```

For more config, debugging help, or getting vim-lsp to work with ALE, see
[this example vimrc](https://github.com/jHwls/dotfiles/blob/4425a4feef823512d96b92e5fd64feaf442485c9/vimrc#L239).

### Helix

*Note: This configuration is applicable for Helix version 23.09 and above.*

Add the language server to your `~/.config/helix/languages.toml` config.
In the case that the file doesn't exist yet, you can create a new file at this location.

```toml
[language-server.lexical]
command = "/my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh"

[[language]]
name = "elixir"
language-servers = ["lexical"]

[[language]]
name = "heex"
language-servers = ["lexical"]
```
