# Installation

The following instructions document how to install Lexical after
building from source. Some editors, like Visual Studio Code, have the
ability to automatically install the latest version of Lexical for
you.

## Caveats

Lexical supports the following versions of Elixir and Erlang:

| Erlang      | Version range    | Notes  |
| ----------- |----------------- | ------ |
|  24         | `>= 24.3.4.12`   | Might run on older versions; this was the lowest that would compile on arm |
|  25         | `>= 25.0`        |        |
|  26         | `>= 26.0.2`      |        |
|  27         | `>= 27.0`        | Will use dramatically more memory due to a bug in Erlang's ETS table compression  |

| Elixir   | Version Range  | Notes    |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1.13     |    `>= 1.13.4` |          |
| 1.14     |    `all`       |          |
| 1.15     | `>= 1.15.3`    | `1.15.0` - `1.15.2` had compiler bugs that prevented lexical from working |
| 1.16     | `>= 1.16.0`    |          |
| 1.17     | `>= 1.17.0`    |          |

Lexical can run projects in any version of Elixir and Erlang that it
supports, but it's important to understand that Lexical needs to be
compiled under the lowest version of elixir and erlang that you intend
to use it with. That means if you have the following projects:

   * `first`: elixir `1.14.4` erlang `24.3.2`
   * `second`: elixir `1.14.3` erlang `25.0`
   * `third`: elixir: `1.13.3` erlang `25.2.3`

Lexical would need to be compiled with Erlang `24.3.2` and Elixir `1.13.3`.
Lexical's prepackaged builds use Erlang `24.3.4.12` and Elixir `1.13.4`

## Prerequisites
First, Install git LFS by [following these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

Then, clone the git repository. Do this with

```elixir
git clone git@github.com:lexical-lsp/lexical.git
```

Then change to the lexical directory

```shell
cd lexical
```

Then fetch lexical's dependencies

```shell
mix deps.get
```

...and build the project

```shell
mix package
```

If things complete successfully, you will then have a release in your
`_build/dev/package/lexical` directory. If you see errors, please file a
bug.

For the following examples, assume the absolute path to your Lexical
source code is `/my/home/projects/lexical`.

## Editor-specific setup
1. [Vanilla Emacs with lsp-mode](#vanilla-emacs-with-lsp-mode)
2. [Vanilla Emacs with eglot](#vanilla-emacs-with-eglot)
3. [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code)
4. [neovim](#neovim)
5. [LunarVim](#lunarvim)
6. [Vim + ALE](#vim--ale)
7. [Vim + Vim-LSP](#vim--vim-lsp)
8. [Helix](#helix)
9. [Sublime Text](#sublime-text)

### Vanilla Emacs with lsp-mode
The emacs instructions assume you're using `use-package`, which you
really should be. In your `.emacs.d/init.el` (or wherever you put your
emacs configuration), insert the following code:

```lisp
(use-package lsp-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq lsp-modeline-code-actions-segments '(count icon name))

  :init
  '(lsp-mode))


(use-package elixir-mode
  :ensure t
  :custom
  (lsp-elixir-server-command '("/my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh")))

```

Restart emacs, and Lexical should start when you open a file with a
`.ex` extension.


### Vanilla Emacs with eglot

Eglot in Emacs 30 already has built-in support for Lexical after
commit 9e0524a8820fbb8fdb155b1ca58919dcfcaffd63.

If you're using Emacs 30 and before that commit, it's recommended to
update Emacs, but you can add lexical support in the following way:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (setf (alist-get '(elixir-mode elixir-ts-mode heex-ts-mode)
                   eglot-server-programs
                   nil nil #'equal)
        (if (and (fboundp 'w32-shell-dos-semantics)
                 (w32-shell-dos-semantics))
            '("language_server.bat")
          (eglot-alternatives
           '("language_server.sh" "start_lexical.sh")))))
```

For versions before 30, you can add Eglot support for Lexical in the
following way:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (setf (alist-get 'elixir-mode eglot-server-programs)
        (if (and (fboundp 'w32-shell-dos-semantics)
                 (w32-shell-dos-semantics))
            '("language_server.bat")
          (eglot-alternatives
           '("language_server.sh" "start_lexical.sh")))))
```

If you're using `elixir-ts-mode` on Emacs 29, you can add a new entry
for Eglot:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               `((elixir-ts-mode heex-ts-mode) .
                 ,(if (and (fboundp 'w32-shell-dos-semantics)
                           (w32-shell-dos-semantics))
                      '("language_server.bat")
                    (eglot-alternatives
                     '("language_server.sh" "start_lexical.sh"))))))
```


### Visual Studio Code

Click on the extensions button on the sidebar, then search for
`lexical`, then click `install`.  By default, the extension will automatically
download the latest version of Lexical.

To change to a local executable, go to `Settings -> Extensions -> Lexical` and
type `/my/home/projects/lexical/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin` into the text box in
the `Server: Release path override` section.

### neovim

Lexical requires neovim `>= 0.9.0`.

In version `>= 0.9.0`, the key is to append the custom LS
configuration to
[lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig), so regardless
of whether you are using mason or others, you can use this
configuration below as a reference:

```lua
require('lspconfig').lexical.setup {
  cmd = { "my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh" },
  root_dir = function(fname)
    return util.root_pattern("mix.exs", ".git")(fname) or vim.loop.cwd()
  end,
  filetypes = { "elixir", "eelixir", "heex" },
  -- optional settings
  settings = {}
}
```

If the configuration above doesn't work for you, please try this minimal [neovim configuration](https://github.com/scottming/nvim-mini-for-lexical), It can eliminate other plugin factors.

### LunarVim

[LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) is a neovim configuration package with a lot of goodies built-in, while remaining very configurable.

First, add this to your configuration:

```lua
-- Add `elixirls` to `skipped_servers` list
vim.list_extend(lvim.lsp.automatic_configuration.skipped_servers, { "elixirls" })

-- Remove `lexical` from `skipped_servers` list
lvim.lsp.automatic_configuration.skipped_servers = vim.tbl_filter(function(server)
  return server ~= "lexical"
end, lvim.lsp.automatic_configuration.skipped_servers)
```

This is necessary because LunarVim defaults to `elixirls` so we must ignore it first. Otherwise you'll have both `lexical` and `elixirls` running when you open Elixir files.

Remove `elixirls` from the `lvim.lsp.installer.setup.ensure_installed = { ... }` list so it does not get automatically reinstalled.

Optionally run `:LspUninstall elixirls` from within neovim if you don't want to keep `elixirls` around.

Then use the same configuration as the one in the [neovim](#neovim) section.

### Vim + ALE

[ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) includes built-in LSP support for Lexical.
To enable it, you'll need to tell ALE where your Lexical release is located (including
the `bin` directory) and add `lexical` to the list of enabled Elixir linters.

A good way to do this is to add the following to a `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/elixir.vim`
file:

```viml
let b:ale_linters = ['lexical', 'mix']
let b:ale_elixir_lexical_release = '/my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin'
```

That will automatically enable the `lexical` and `mix` linters for all buffers with
the `elixir` file type.

### Vim + Vim-LSP

An example of configuring Lexical as the Elixir language server for
[Vim-LSP](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp). Uses the newer vim9script syntax but
can be converted to Vim 8 etc (`:h vim9script`).

```vim9script

# Loading vim-lsp with minpac:
call minpac#add("prabirshrestha/vim-lsp")
# ...or use your package manager of choice/Vim native packages

# Useful for debugging vim-lsp:
# g:lsp_log_verbose = 1
# g:lsp_log_file = expand('~/vim-lsp.log')

# Configure as the elixir language server
if executable("elixir")
    augroup lsp_lexical
    autocmd!
    autocmd User lsp_setup call lsp#register_server({ name: "lexical", cmd: (server_info) => "{{path_to_lexical}}/lexical-lsp/lexical/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh", allowlist: ["elixir", "eelixir"] })
    autocmd FileType elixir setlocal omnifunc=lsp#complete
    autocmd FileType eelixir setlocal omnifunc=lsp#complete
    augroup end
endif

```

If you use [Vim-LSP-Settings](mattn/vim-lsp-settings) for installing and configuring language servers,
you can use the following flag to disable prompts to install elixir-ls:

```viml
g:lsp_settings_filetype_elixir = ["lexical"]

```

For more config, debugging help, or getting vim-lsp to work with ALE, see
[this example vimrc](https://github.com/jHwls/dotfiles/blob/4425a4feef823512d96b92e5fd64feaf442485c9/vimrc#L239).

### Helix

*Note: This configuration is applicable for Helix version 23.09 and above.*

Add the language server to your `~/.config/helix/languages.toml` config.
In the case that the file doesn't exist yet, you can create a new file at this location.

```toml
[language-server.lexical]
command = "/my/home/projects/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/start_lexical.sh"

[[language]]
name = "elixir"
language-servers = ["lexical"]

[[language]]
name = "heex"
language-servers = ["lexical"]
```

### Sublime Text

#### Background

Lexical can be used with Sublime Text via the [LSP-Sublime](https://lsp.sublimetext.io/) package, which integrates Language Servers with Sublime Text. If you don't have the LSP-Sublime package installed already, [install it with Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP).

There is currently no [language server package](https://lsp.sublimetext.io/language_servers/) specifically for Lexical that works with LSP-Sublime so we'll need to create a [custom client configuration](https://lsp.sublimetext.io/client_configuration/).

#### Installation

First, ensure that you have Lexical [installed from source](https://github.com/lexical-lsp/lexical/blob/main/pages/installation.md#prerequisites) correctly and note the full path of the directory with Lexical's executables:

Print the full path of the directory holding the Lexical executables:
`cd {directory_you_cloned_lexical_to}/_build/dev/package/lexical/bin/ && pwd`

Then, install LSP-Sublime with Package Control if you haven't already.

Next, open up the LSP settings in Sublime. You can do this by invoking the command palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + p`) and selecting `Preferences: LSP Settings`.

You'll need to add a key called `"clients"` in the top-level `LSP.sublime-settings` JSON dictionary that is as follows:

```json
"clients": {
  "elixir-lexical": {
    "enabled": true,
    "command": ["{output_from_pwd_cmd_above}/start_lexical.sh", ""],
    "selector": "source.elixir"
  }
}
```
_note: you can name elixir-lexical whatever you like, it's just for your own identification_

Upon saving the configuration, LSP-Sublime should enable the new `elixir-lexical` LSP server. Go into an Elixir file and you should now see `elixir-lexical` in the lower left of the status bar. If not, invoke the command palette and select `LSP: Enable Language Server Globally/In Project` and it should run.
